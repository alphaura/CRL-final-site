# CRL-final-site
 This is the final challenge of the CRL 21 day course, creating a full webpage, while being repsosive to different device sizes.

 It has helped me get a better grasp to having clean and strong HTML structure that is easily understandable and that makes sense and good use for CSS and JS later on the process. The CSS testing here has helped me understand more the layout process using Flexbox which is like level 1 of layout structuring, in combination of proper HTML structuring and good use of media queries.

 The main goal of this project was to see what I've learned in this 21 day course, and put everything to the test to actually code a design provided by Kevin Powell and code it thinking mobile-first so that the site works properly across all display sizes to be responsive.
